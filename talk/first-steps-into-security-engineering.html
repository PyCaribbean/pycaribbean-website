    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Experience with security is a useful and even profitable skill for every technical and non-technical employee in IT. Contrary to common stereotypes, security is far more than black hoodies, math and crypto. It's also humans and communication skills. Attendees of my talks regularly ask me how to get started. Let me introduce you to diverse areas of info sec and point you to books, online courses, talks, and other resources to get you started.</p>
