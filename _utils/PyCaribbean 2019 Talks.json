We know we should automate our tests, but it takes time and effort. **pytest-bdd**, a plugin for the awesome **pytest** framework, makes it *much* easier to write tests by enabling Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) features. Using **pytest-bdd**, teams write tests in plain language using Gherkin (e.g., Given-When-Then steps), and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. And all the goodness of **pytest** is available. An example test could be:\n\n*Given* the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed\n*When* the user searches the phrase \"Python\"\n*Then* search results for \"Python\" are shown\n\nThis talk will teach how to use **pytest-bdd** to develop well-designed test scenarios and a robust automation framework.

        "description": "At the advent of object-oriented programming, inheritance and the class hierarchy reigned supreme. You could model _anything_, from `Animal` all the way down to `Animal` -> `Mammal` -> `Dog` -> `UtilityDog` -> `FrenchBulldog`. Eventually this got out of hand.\n\nToday, composition brings many of the benefits of complex inheritance while keeping functionality focused and isolated. In many languages, composition is achieved via the interface pattern; an object can declare its intent to _implement_ a particular interface and as a result is beholden to support the behaviors that interface outlines. In Python, there is no such thing as an interface! What do we do about that?\n\nFortunately, Python provides the ability to support something interface-like (and more) via _multiple inheritance_. In multiple inheritance, an object may inherit from multiple other objects. Let's explore how this works, what pitfalls to look out for, and how not to repeat the past when dealing with class hierarchies.",

Many people wishing to develop penetration testing skills are unaware of the number of resources available to them to set up a controlled environment where they can legally test hacking tools and techniques.\n\nIn this lightning talk, I will briefly cover a wide range of resources available to attendees, and how they can be used as learning tools. The resources I will cover include pre-built vulnerable virtual machines and web applications, open source tools that can be used in conjunction with Python for discovery/enumeration/exploitation, competitions and challenges, trainings geared towards hacking with Python, and certifications.\n\nI will also outline general safe practices to ensure attendees understand what is and isn't legal, and the consequences of not staying within ethical boundaries. During the talk, a link will be displayed so that participants can easily save a list of the resources outlined in this talk with additional information to reference later.\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Provide an ongoing centralized repository for helpful resources to promote safe and legal hacking\n- Outline general safe hacking practices to create awareness of what is acceptable and what could result in legal implications\n- Share trusted sources of vulnerable targets which can be used to build a home lab for penetration testing with Python\n- Introduce sources of vetted Python exploits and how to test them while discouraging the use of unknown/untrusted exploits\n- Provide a list of trusted open source tools what can be used for recon, scanning, and exploitation within a home lab\n- Discuss valuable trainings that can be pursued to develop Python hacking skills and potentially obtain certifications\n- Describe the benefits of participating in hacking competitions and challenges, either individually or on a team\n\n## Resource Sample\n\nBelow is a small sample of some of the resources that will be included in the repository and discussed in the lightning talk.\n\n- Vulnerable machines: Vulnhub, Metasploitable\n- Vulnerable web applications: DVWA, bWAPP, XVWA, various OWASP apps/VMs\n- Penetration testing tools: Kali Linux, exploit-db, pypcap, scapy\n- Training/certifications: OSCP, CEH, SANS GPEN, HackerSploit\n- Competitions/challenges: picoCTF, pwnable, MITRE CTF\n",

Yet our community often points to Professional Software Engineering as the \"proper\" way to code. I'll demonstrate that these styles can both be done with basic or advanced Python. After that, I'll look at practices that may benefit one, but not the other, discuss when there may be shifts between the two, and examine how we as existing community members can help guide new members down the path that best fits their goals. This maximizes their chance for success and our chance to add new contributors to our community. Let's not forget: Python is a FLOSS project. We need all the help we can get.

        "description": "By now you have probably all heard about Python static typing. But why should you care? Are types in Python even Pythonic? Is Python turning into Java? Type annotations are Pythonic, trust Guido's word for it, and Python is definitely not turning into Java.\n\nI joined the Facebook London office in early 2016 after finishing university. At that time my team was running Python 2.7 and we had just 2 engineers. These days we are running 100% typed Python 3.6, have 8 engineers and 3 interns. In 2017 we flipped the switch from 2 to 3 and started aggressively typing the codebase, at that time we had only 3 engs.\n\nIn the first year of the team we managed to hire only 1 eng, the second year 6. So what made the difference? At Facebook, people go through Bootcamp and complete tasks from teams they are interested in before taking a decision on which to join. Having a codebase that's easy to navigate and understand is key to attract talent! Type annotations achieve just that, even without using a type checker.\n\nThe greatest benefit of types in large Python codebases is the fact that the input and output structures of a function are obvious from just looking at the signature. In the untyped world the definition for the class you are looking for may be N jumps away, hidden somewhere deep in the codebase, and you don't have a direct reference to it. In the best possible case grepping for it will yield just a few results and you will be able to spot what you are looking for. In the worst case though, you will have hundreds of hits and you will have to run your application and inspect the type at runtime to figure out what is going on, which make the development cycle slow and tedious.\n\nCome to this talk if you want to know more about the typing system in Python, how to gradually add it to your codebase and what benefits will your team get in the long run! I will also cover FB specific technologies like our runtime type collection system, MonkeyType, and the just open sourced type checker, Pyre!",

        "description": "Most people dread the annual review process. It is difficult to remember everything you have done and summarize it in a concise, clear way. As engineers, there is the additional factor of translating technical achievements into a format business folks can understand. I propose a solution for tracking and reporting achievements in a way that's simple and easy for stakeholders to understand.\n\nThis talk will consist of two main parts. After outlining the difficulty of annual reviews with a real life example, I will explain the manual solution of success statements. A success statement is a sentence that explains a single achievement and how it contributes to the bottom line. This is a great place to start, but can be tedious to add up all the information for reports.\n\nThe second part is about the AWS based app I created and how you can use it to store and automatically summarize the data multiple ways. I will explain how serverless apps are a great way for those without DevOps experience to get an app up easily. I'll get into the different ways to manipulate the data and how to deploy the app to have a personal ROI Tracker. The repository is publicly available to make it easy for the attendees to dig in and review the code themselves after the talk.\n",

When you hear artificial intelligence you might think of complex solutions as self-driving cars, autonomous drones and robots or smart assistants as Alexa or Siri - but it doesn't have to be that complex. You can build a powerful image classification model within a topic that inspires and interests you - with 3 easy steps. First, find a topic that interests you; it can be something that inspires you, excites you or a super simple day-to-day problem you're facing. Which of your skills are matching your interests and other topics that excites you? Use that skill set to the next step, which is creating your own data.\n\nMy day-to-day repetitive problem was the daily makeup routine; it takes time and its quite uninspiring but when you finally decide to try something new - you literally get over 30 million results when search for makeup tutorial on Youtube and beauty being a $400 billion industry indicates that makeup play a significant part of people's lives. How do you even know what makeup style will look as good on you as it does on all the YouTubers?\n\nTherefore I built my very first machine learning algorithm which tells you which eye shape you have and suggests makeup styles matching your particular eye shape to enhances your features. You just snap a photo of your eyes in the app and the algorithm does the rest; telling you which eye shape you have and what makeup style that suits your particular eye shape. I build this app with 3 easy steps and I'm excited to show how you can build yourself an own powerful image classification model, with your own data, within a topic that inspires and interests you. It might sound difficult but I can't wait to show you how few lines of Python you need to build the whole app.\n\nThis talk is for machine learning beginners - by a beginner: I built this classification model with very little experience and the emphasis of this talk is to inform that it is possible to get state of the art results on niches which lack data and that it still exists low having fruits in numerous verticals.\n\nThe essence of the talk is to encourage and inspire to implement data science on niches and verticals that aligns with your own interests.\n\nWhat repetitive and categorizing tasks are you regularly facing? Bring your interests, passion and everyday problems and we'll explore a concrete and more widespread adoption of artificial intelligence solutions.",

Historically, Python packaging has been a source of significant pain for even the most devoted Python enthusiasts.\n\nIn this talk I'll be covering all the required instructions and a quick overview of the current state of Python packaging tools. I'll mostly focus on setuptools, pip and wheels, putting an emphasis on their superiority over their precursors. I'll also list down the honorable mentions of tools worth knowing.

All this can be done without heavy maths background, by building on the existing technology, pretrained models and community knowledge.\nSimilar to how web frameworks such as Django make application development easier, there are now several popular ML frameworks such as Keras and PyTorch. They free you from low-level math-intensive coding tasks, and instead make it easy to focus on the higher-level aspects of the problems you're trying to solve.\n\nThe author got started with machine learning less than 1 year ago, after years of doing web development with Python and Django.

        "description": "*Can you remember the difference between two hex color values? Me neither!* Entering visual representations of recently-changed elements into version control makes review of past changes easier & speeds acclimation to a new web project, especially for visual learners. Surprisingly, methods for including images in your version control aren't standardized and are rarely used outside of large companies, and the rest of us are left checking out every major commit and viewing changes locally! Join me for a review of methods currently in use and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each. The audience will learn from a survey of tools used by both designers and web developers, what methods are most appropriate for individual projects, & how these methods differ from those used at some of the largest companies (Google, eBay, etc.). Finding a method to track changes in your visual elements will save our future contributors (and future selves!) the pain of having to distinguish #2dc651 (lime green) from #34a34e (darker(!) lime green) and ultimately make our commit histories cleaner and our repos easier to navigate in ways that many of us have never imagined!",

        "bio": "Hola, Soy Wildin Mota. Tengo 19 años de edad y actualmente trabajo como Python Developer en PibiCloud, aunque para cuando llegue la conferencia seguro seré FullStack, incluso hasta haciendo Machine Learning, pero eso no es seguro aún.\n\nSoy un apasionado del software desde los 14 estoy en este mundo estudiando por mi cuenta mi primera interacción programando fue usando bat en windows, el cual aprendí en un libro de HackXRank. Desde que inicié, nunca lo he dejado y siempre me he mantenido curioso, ya el resto es historia de estudio y consistencia.\n\nA mis 17 vendí mi primer proyecto de software el cual era un sistema de ventas para la Ferretería Chelo, este lo hice en C# y SQL Server. Estaba tan emocionado y motivado que hasta amanecía programando, lo más duro que hice fueron 14 horas seguidas, bebí un montón de café ese día para poder aguantar tal trabajo.\n\nA los 18, al graduarme de bachiller en mi pueblo, la Vega, me sentí arrinconado y con un futuro escrito en La Vega. Sólo una universidad da Software como carrera y no hay empresas en esta área interesantes, además estaba ansioso de un cambio drástico. A los pocos días me inscribí en el ITLA sin consentimiento de mis padres, yo trabajaba como técnico, así que pude pagar yo mismo el derecho a admisión y los viajes a Santo Domingo para los exámenes. Desde hace tiempo quería trabajar, mientras estaba en la universidad era algo que quería bastante, pero al inscribirme en el ITLA se convirtió en necesidad, porque mis padres no podían pagarlo y yo tampoco quería que lo hicieran, porque era algo que yo quería y yo debía proveerlo por mi mismo. Es importante notar que yo enviaba CV's a una empresa a la vez y esperaba hasta que me dieran respuesta, porque me parecía mal el hecho de ser aceptado por más de una y después tener que rechazar a alguien que me dio una oportunidad, pero después de ver que eso no funcionaba y viendo la necesidad de tener ingresos entré a emplea.do y mande CV a diestra y siniestra en todas que yo tuviera las requisitos, incluso Instacarro me devolvió el mensaje, pero pospuse la entrevista sin saber que era algo que no se veía muy bien y no volví a tener respuesta.  Al final, una empresa me escribió a las pocas horas de mandar la solicitud y otra me llamó al siguiente día, me enfoqué en esas dos. Para no alargar la historia, me quedé con la primera empresa que es Castillo Software Solutions, estaba en un puesto que sólo era HTML y CSS, algo que no me ponía muy feliz, pero yo se que lo convertiría en algo más. Con el tiempo pedí a la empresa que me dieran issues en Angular y así fue, eso me mantuvo con retos por un tiempo, pero aun para mi no era suficiente yo quería ser backend developer y tenía que serlo de una.\n\nA mis 9-10 meses trabajando en CastilloSS un amigo me mandó una oferta laboral como Python Dev usando Django/Flask y además haciendo Angular e Ionic, tecnologías que aprendí para CastilloSS. Es curioso decir que cuando pedí hacer tareas en angular aún no había visto un curso básico completo de Angular, pero me manejaba bastante bien con JS y me desenvolví bien, terminaba mis tareas a tiempo y me dejaron sólo haciendo Angular.\n\nPues conseguí el trabajo y sentí que una puerta de un montón de posibilidades se abrió ante mí, es que en esta empresa mi jefe es un genio con un montón de experiencia dispuesto a mostrarnos todo e incluso hizo una serie de libros para volverse senior si los entiendes bien, los cuales ya estoy leyendo, me gusta bastante donde trabajo ahora y pienso ir a ayudar en tantas áreas como pueda, no hay límites.\n\nCorté bastante la historia para no escribir mas XD, lo siento.",
