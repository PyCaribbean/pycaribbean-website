    <h2>Who is Rene Olivo?</h2>
    <p>I'm a Dominican front-end developer who has seen it all. From the fall of the tables to the rise of modern frameworks. Currently, I'm working for Compucorp, a UK based agency. Our main product is CiviHR, an open source HR app for non-profits.</p><p>I have been part of a lot of teams and worked using multiple frameworks. This has allowed me to learn what works and what is bound to fail in the long run, and more so in a production environment. I enjoy sharing these findings with the community as well as learning from it.</p>
