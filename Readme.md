# PyCaribbean Landing Page


To run the project you will need to install jekyll


Installing jekyll
----------
	gem install jekyll


**While using OSX i had to install rvm first and update to the latest version of ruby, you can find a guide [here](https://coderwall.com/p/4imsra/upgrading-ruby-to-2-1-0-and-above-in-mavericks)
**

After installing jekyll just run from the base directory

	jekyll serve


After running the command you'll get something like the following in the command line

	Configuration file: /Users/eatskolnikov/Projects/pycaribbean.github.io/_config.yml
